The latest CAD files can downloaded from `this link. <https://github.com/gocivici/trinteract/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_ The CAD files can be edited in Fusion360. You can also use the .stl files directly for the 3D printing.

The 3D prints were done on a fdm printer with a eSun PLA+ filament. The following settings were used for the print:

* Layer Height: 0.25mm
* Wall thickness: 1.2mm
* infill: 50%
* Generate support, Overhang Angle:60
