About Trinteract
----------------

Trinteract was developed as part of an Interaction design Masters thesis project in May 2023, the starting point for the project was the challanges of navigating 3D environments and 
the absence of universal  3D  input  devices for the average user. 

It combines the advantages of the mouse and existing commercial devices like the SpaceMouse to provide an easy-to-learn customizable 3DOF navigation experience.
