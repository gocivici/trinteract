The latest PCB files can downloaded from `this link <https://github.com/gocivici/trinteract/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_

There are two subfolders under the PCB folder. One contains the KiCAD files that can be edited and customized. The other folder titled "Gerbers" contains the manufacture ready files 
that can be directly sent to a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB.
